    PD)) * 100\r\nD means Downtime during the Measurement Period.\r\nDowntime means
    any period of time where the entire HoloMe Asset Conversion Platform is unavailable
    as confirmed by HoloMe\u2019s monitoring that is not Permitted Downtime.\r\nMeasurement
    Period means a given calendar month (00:00 on first day to 23:59 last day).\r\nPD
    means Permitted Downtime during the Measurement Period.\r\nPermitted Downtime
    means scheduled maintenance periods where the entirety of the HoloMe Asset Conversion
    Platform is not available or emergency downtime that is scheduled on an urgent
    basis.\r\nSH means Service Hours (24\xD77) during the Measurement Period.\r\nPermitted
    Downtime means HoloMe is allowed Permitted Downtime. HoloMe will work in collaboration
    with the Customer to agree appropriate system maintenance windows determined
    always by HoloMe. Although HoloMe is typically able to provide a zero hours\u2019
    downtime maintenance window, HoloMe reserves the right at its discretion to schedule
    a 1 to 3 hour downtime maintenance window when the HoloMe Asset Conversion Platform
    will not be available. Notice of Permitted Downtime will be given in writing
    to the Customer. The notice period for Permitted Downtime is five (5) Business
    Days (except where emergency downtime needs to be scheduled in which case no
    notice will be required).\r\n \r\nAVAILABILITY EXCLUSION\r\nThe Availability
    set out at clause 1.1 of this Schedule 3 does not apply to any unavailability,
    suspension or termination of the HoloMe Asset Conversion Platform, or any other
    performance issues:\r\nresulting from a suspension as described in the Agreement;\r\ncaused
    by factors outside of HoloMe\u2019s reasonable control, including any force majeure
    event, internet access, or problems beyond the demarcation point of the HoloMe
    Asset Conversion Platform;\r\nresulting from any actions or inactions of the
    Customer or any third party;\r\nresulting from the equipment, software or other
    technology of the Customer or third party (other than third party equipment within
    HoloMe\u2019s direct control);\r\nresulting from failures of the HoloMe Asset
    Conversion Platform not attributable to Downtime except where it is stated; or\r\nresulting
    from any Permitted Downtime.\r\n \r\nSchedule 4  \u2013 DATA PROTECTION\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n\u201Cdata

    Customer will ensure that it and any other data controllers of the Customer Personal
    Data:\r\nhave complied and will continue to comply with their obligations under
    the Data Protection Laws, including ensuring that it is fair and lawful for HoloMe,
    its staff and sub-contractors to process the Customer Data;\r\nhave all necessary
    and appropriate consents and notices in place so that HoloMe may lawfully receive,
    transfer, use and process the Customer Data for the duration and purposes of
    this Agreement;\r\nThe Customer warrants that it and any other data controllers
    of the Customer Personal Data shall not knowingly transmit Children\u2019s Data
    or Sensitive Personal Data to HoloMe or via the HoloMe Asset Conversion Platform.\r\nThe
    Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless HoloMe against all claims,
    fines (including regulatory fines), actions, proceedings, losses, damages, expenses
    and costs (including without limitation court costs and reasonable legal fees)
    arising out of or in connection with the Customer\u2019s breach of its obligations
    under this Schedule 4.\r\nHoloMe shall, in providing the Services, comply with
    its Data Protection and Information Security Policies relating to the privacy
    and security of the Customer Personal Data, as such documents may be amended
    from time to time by HoloMe.\r\n \r\nPROCESSING ON CUSTOMER\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS\r\nWhen
    processing Customer Personal Data in connection with the performance of HoloMe\u2019s
    obligations under this Agreement, HoloMe will act only in accordance with the
    lawful and documented instructions of the Customer as set out in this Agreement
    or as provided in writing by the Customer from time to time (subject to HoloMe\u2019s
    right to charge additional sums at its then-current rates should the scope of
    the agreed Services be exceeded), unless HoloMe is required by law to process
    the Customer Personal Data. Where HoloMe is relying on applicable law as the
    basis for processing Customer Personal Data, HoloMe shall notify the Customer
    before performing the processing required by law unless such laws prohibit HoloMe
    from notifying the Customer.\r\nThe Customer hereby instructs HoloMe to process
    the Customer Personal Data:\r\nfor the provision of the Services and the HoloMe
    Asset Conversion Platform (and for each of these purposes HoloMe may share such
    Customer Personal Data with HoloMe\u2019s Sub-processors as necessary to provide
    the Services);\r\nfor the purpose of fulfilling its obligations and exercising
    its rights under this Agreement;\r\nas may be required by law, court order or
    any governmental or regulatory authority; and\r\nuntil the date that HoloMe ceases
    to provide the Services to the Customer.\r\nThe Customer acknowledges that HoloMe
    processes the Customer Data on the Customer\u2019s instructions. Consequently,
    HoloMe shall not be liable for any claim brought by a data subject arising from
    any action or omission by HoloMe, to the extent that such action or omission
    resulted directly from the Customer\u2019s instructions.\r\nThe Customer acknowledges
    that the HoloMe Asset Conversion Platform supports secure transmission of data.
    To the extent that the Customer chooses to transfer data to or from HoloMe by
    an insecure method or instructs HoloMe to transmit data to or receive data from
    third parties who do not support secure transmission of data, the Customer accepts
    the risks related to such transmission. \r\nAnnex 1 sets out the nature and purpose
    of the processing, the types of Customer Personal Data HoloMe processes and the
    categories of data subjects whose personal data are processed.\r\nHoloMe shall
    notify the Customer if it considers that an instruction from the Customer is
    in breach of Data Protection Laws, and HoloMe shall be entitled but not obliged
    to suspend execution of the instructions concerned, until the Customer confirms
    such instructions in writing.\r\n\r\nHOLOME OBLIGATIONS\r\nIn relation to any
    Customer Personal Data processed in connection with the performance of its obligations
    under this Agreement, HoloMe shall:\r\nImplement appropriate technical and organisational
    measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of Customer Personal
    Data and against accidental, unauthorised or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
    disclosure or access to Customer Personal Data;\r\nAt the Customer\u2019s written
    request, assist the Customer in responding to any request from a data subject
    necessary for compliance with its obligations under the Data Protection Laws;\r\nNotify
    the Customer without undue delay upon becoming aware of any Security Breach involving
    Customer Personal Data;\r\nAt the Customer\u2019s written request, taking into
    account the nature of processing and the information available to HoloMe, assist
    the Customer with its obligations under Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR and the
    Data Protection Laws with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments
    and consultations with supervisory authorities or regulators;\r\nAt the Customer\u2019s
    written request, taking into account the nature of processing and the information
    available to HoloMe, assist the Customer by making available to the Customer
    all information which the Customer reasonably requests to allow the Customer
    to demonstrate that the obligations set out in Article 28 of the GDPR relating
    to the appointment of processors have been met;\r\nMaintain complete and accurate
    records of all processing operations under its responsibility. Such records shall
    contain the information required by the Data Protection Laws;\r\nOn the Customer\u2019s
    written request, allow the Customer and its respective auditors or authorised
    agents to conduct audits or inspections of HoloMe within business hours during
    the term of the Agreement, on ten (10) Business Days\u2019 prior written notice
    from the Customer. The purposes of any audit pursuant to this paragraph is to
    verify that HoloMe is processing Customer Personal Data in accordance with its
    obligations under this Agreement.\r\nThe Customer undertakes to treat the results
    of such audits and inspections as Confidential Information and to ensure that
    its agents do likewise;\r\nAt the Customer\u2019s written request, delete or
    return to the Customer any Customer Personal Data after the end of the provision
    of the Services, unless applicable law requires longer storage of the Customer
    Personal Data;\r\nEnsure that all HoloMe personnel who have access to or process
    the Customer Personal Data are subject to a binding duty of confidentiality and
    have received appropriate training on Data Protection Laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoloMe
    will not generally charge for responding to the Customer\u2019s written requests
    (as set out above in this paragraph), but reserves the right, at its sole discretion,
    to charge reasonable fees based on the administrative costs of providing such
    assistance, if provision of such assistance requires excessive resources or occurs
    at an excessive frequency.\r\nSUB-PROCESSORS AND DATA TRANSFERS\r\nThe Customer
    agrees that HoloMe may transfer the Customer Personal Data or give access to
    Customer Personal Data to third party suppliers as Sub-processors for the purpose
    of providing the Services, provided that HoloMe complies with the provisions
    of this Agreement.\r\nHoloMe shall ensure that it enters into written agreements
    with its Sub-processors which incorporate terms which are materially equivalent
    to those in paragraph 3 and as are required by applicable Data Protection Laws.\r\nHoloMe
    shall remain responsible for its Sub-processor\u2019s compliance with the obligations
    of this Schedule.\r\nA list of Sub-Processors approved as at the date of this
    Agreement is as follows: Amazon Web Services; Apple iTunes; Google Play; Gmail
    (Google); Google Analytics; JBiDesign; TEN10 Engineering; Axmor; and 8th Wall.
    This list may be updated from time to time. \r\nHoloMe can at any time appoint
    a new Sub-processor. The Customer may legitimately object to the appointment
    of a new Sub-processor within  (10) Business Days . Legitimate objections must
    contain reasonable and documented grounds relating to a Sub-processor\u2019s
    non-compliance with applicable Data Protection Laws. If, in HoloMe\u2019s reasonable
    opinion, such objections are legitimate, HoloMe shall refrain from using such
    Sub-processor to process Customer Personal Data. In such cases, HoloMe may use
    commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the Customer a change in
    the Services to avoid the processing of Customer Personal Data by the objected-to
    Sub-processor.\r\nThe Customer hereby agrees that HoloMe may transfer the Customer
    Personal Data outside the EEA or to Sub-processors outside the EEA where HoloMe
    participates in a cross-border transfer mechanism which is valid under the Data
    Protection Laws and after providing the Customer with sufficient notice (as set
    out in this paragraph 4). Valid cross-border transfer mechanisms include:\r\ntransfers
    to a country which is subject to an adequacy decision of the European Commission;\r\ntransfers
    permitted under the EU-US Privacy Shield;\r\ntransfers permitted under an approved
    code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 GDPR or an approved certification mechanism
    pursuant to Article 42 GDPR, in each case together with binding and enforceable
    commitments of the Sub-processor to apply the appropriate safeguards, including
    as regards data subject\u2019s rights;\r\ntransfers permitted through execution
    of the Standard Contractual Clauses (controller to processor transfers). The
    Customer hereby authorises HoloMe to enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses
    (as set out at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec/2010/87/oj) with the Sub-processor
    in the Customer\u2019s name and on its behalf. HoloMe shall be the \u201Cdata
    exporter\u201D on behalf of the Customer and the Sub-processor shall be \u201Cdata
    importer\u201D. \r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\nIn the event of any conflict or inconsistency
    between the provisions of the Agreement and this Schedule, the provisions of
    these terms shall prevail. Save as specifically modified and amended in these
    terms, all of the terms, provisions and requirements contained in the Agreement
    shall remain in full force and effect and govern these terms. \r\nHoloMe shall
    be entitled to retain and process Performance Data for internal business purposes
    such as improving its Services,  benchmarking, trend evaluation, industry wide
    analytics, analysis of potential fraudulent Customer activity and for developing
    and commercially exploiting products and services offered to third parties that
    incorporate Performance Data. In all such cases Performance Data will only be
    shared with third parties in a form that does not enable the third party to identify
    data subjects. The Customer hereby authorises and irrevocably licenses HoloMe
    to use Performance Data for the purposes specified above, subject always to the
    Performance Data being supplied to third parties on an anonymised and aggregated
    basis.\r\nANNEX 1 TO SCHEDULE 4: DATA PROTECTION\r\nThis summary sets out details

    THIS POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING \r\nWhat is in this policy?  \r\nThis acceptable
    use policy (this \"policy\") sets out the standards that apply when you upload
    or generate content using our app, portal or website (together \"our ecosystem\"),
    make contact with other users via our ecosystem, link to our ecosystem, or interact
    with our ecosystem in any other way. \r\nOur ecosystem is operated by Holome
    Technologies Limited (\u201Dwe\u201D or \"us\"). \r\nBy using our ecosystem you
    accept this policy  \r\nBy using our ecosystem, you confirm that you accept this
    policy and that you agree to comply with it.\r\nIf you do not agree to this policy,
    you must not use our ecosystem.\r\n We recommend that you print a copy of this
    policy for future reference.\r\nThere are other terms that may apply to you 
    \r\nOur Terms of Use also apply to your use of our ecosystem.\r\nWe may make
    changes to this policy  \r\nWe amend this policy from time to time. Every time
    you wish to use our ecosystem, please check this policy to ensure you understand
    the terms that apply at that time. By continuing to use or access our ecosystem,
    you confirm that you accept this policy, as it appears here at the relevant time.\r\nProhibited
    uses  \r\n You may use our ecosystem only for lawful purposes. You may not use
    our ecosystem:\r\nin any way that breaches any applicable local, national or
    international law or regulation;\r\nin any way that is unlawful or fraudulent,
    or has any unlawful or fraudulent purpose or effect;\r\nfor the purpose of harming
    or attempting to harm minors in any way;\r\nto bully, insult, intimidate or humiliate
    any person;\r\nto send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use or re-use any
    material which does not comply with this policy;\r\nto transmit, or procure the
    sending of, any unsolicited or unauthorised advertising or promotional material
    or any other form of similar solicitation (spam); or\r\nto knowingly transmit
    any data, send or upload any material that contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms,
    time-bombs, keystroke loggers, spyware, adware or any other harmful programs
    or similar computer code designed to adversely affect the operation of any computer
    software or hardware.\r\nYou also agree:\r\nnot to reproduce, duplicate, copy
    or re-sell any part of our ecosystem in contravention of the provisions of our
    Terms of Use \r\nnot to access without authority, interfere with, damage or disrupt:\r\nany
    part of our ecosystem;\r\nany equipment or network on which our ecosystem is
    stored;\r\nany software used in the provision of our ecosystem; or\r\nany equipment
    or network or software owned or used by any third party.\r\nInteractive services 
    \r\nWe may from time to time provide interactive services on our ecosystem, including,
    without limitation, user like and comment functionality (\"interactive services\").\r\nWhere
    we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you
    about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation
    is used (including whether it is human or technical).\r\nWe will do our best
    to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from
    third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our ecosystem,
    and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of
    the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light
    of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate
    any interactive service we provide on our ecosystem, and we expressly exclude
    our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive
    service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service
    is moderated or not.\r\nThe use of any of our interactive services by a minor
    is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who
    permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that
    they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation
    is not fool proof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made
    aware of the potential risks to them.\r\nWhere we do moderate an interactive
    service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator,
    should a concern or difficulty arise.\r\nContent standards  \r\nThese content
    standards apply to any and all material which you create or contribute to using
    our ecosystem (\"Contribution\"), and to any interactive services associated
    with it.\r\nThese content standards must be complied with in spirit as well as
    to the letter. The standards apply to each part of any Contribution as well as
    to its whole.\r\n Holome Technologies Limited will determine, in its discretion,
    whether a Contribution breaches the Content Standards.\r\n A Contribution must:\r\nbe
    accurate (where it states facts);\r\nbe genuinely held (where it states opinions);
    and\r\ncomply with the law applicable in England and Wales and in any country
    from which it is posted.\r\nA Contribution must not:\r\nbe defamatory of any
    person;\r\nbe obscene, offensive, hateful or inflammatory;\r\nbully, insult,
    intimidate or humiliate;\r\npromote sexually explicit material;\r\npromote violence;\r\npromote
    discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual
    orientation or age;\r\ninfringe any copyright, database right or trademark of
    any other person;\r\nbe likely to deceive any person;\r\nbreach any legal duty
    owed to a third party, such as a contractual duty or a duty of confidence;\r\npromote
    any illegal activity;\r\nbe in contempt of court;\r\nbe threatening, abuse or
    invade another\u2019s privacy, or cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless
    anxiety;\r\nbe likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person;\r\nimpersonate
    any person, or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person;\r\ngive
    the impression that the Contribution emanates from Holome Technologies Limited,
    if this is not the case;\r\nadvocate, promote, incite any party to commit, or
    assist any unlawful or criminal act such as (by way of example only) copyright
    infringement or computer misuse;\r\ncontain a statement which you know or believe,
    or have reasonable grounds for believing, that members of the public to whom
    the statement is, or is to be, published are likely to understand as a direct
    or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation
    or instigation of acts of terrorism; or\r\ncontain any advertising or promote
    any services or web links to other ecosystems.\r\nBreach of this policy  \r\nWhen
    we consider that a breach of this acceptable use policy has occurred, we may
    take such action as we deem appropriate.\r\nFailure to comply with this policy
    constitutes a material breach of the Terms of Use upon which you are permitted
    to use our ecosystem, and may result in our taking all or any of the following
    actions:\r\nimmediate, temporary or permanent withdrawal of your right to use
    our ecosystem;\r\nimmediate, temporary or permanent removal of any Contribution
    uploaded by you to our ecosystem;\r\nissue of a warning to you;\r\nlegal proceedings
    against you for reimbursement of all costs on an indemnity basis (including,
    but not limited to, reasonable administrative and legal costs) resulting from
    the breach;\r\nfurther legal action against you; and/or\r\ndisclosure of such
    information to law enforcement authorities as we reasonably feel is necessary
    or as required by law.\r\nWe exclude our liability for all action we may take
    in response to breaches of this acceptable use policy. The actions we may take
    are not limited to those described above, and we may take any other action we
    reasonably deem appropriate.\r\nHow to complain about content uploaded by other
    users  \r\n If you wish to complain about any Contribution made by other users,
    please contact us.\r\nWhich country\u2019s laws apply to any disputes?  \r\nThis
    policy, its subject matter and its formation are governed by English law. You
    and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction
    except that if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings
    in Northern Ireland, and if you are resident of Scotland, you may also bring
    proceedings in Scotland.\r\n"
